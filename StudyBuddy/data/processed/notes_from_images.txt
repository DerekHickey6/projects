Question 1.

Consider the periodic function x with fundamental period 7 = 2 and funda-
mental frequency @) shown in the figure. Using the Fourier series analy-
sis equation, find the Fourier series coefficient sequence ¢ for the function
x. Your solution must consider the single period of x(t) for 0<1<T.
Your final answer must be fully simplified. You may use the fact that
Jxetdx = 4,e(ax—1) +C for a4 0. [8 marks]

‘Question 2. Using the MATLAB programming language, write a function called count_nonzex6 that takes a matrix = as
input and returns the number of nonzero elements in s. Your code must not eall any other functions other than wc and
hetght. (The wieb function takes a matrix as a parameter and returns the number of columns in the matrix. The nei)

function is similar except it returns the number of sows.) Your code must use proper indentation and must not exceed 15

lines in length. Be sure to use correct syntax in your answer, since syntax clearly matters here. [2 marks]

(A) Find a fully-simplified expression for the magnitude response of the system. [2 marks]

Question 1. A LTI system has the frequency response H(@) =

Question 2. In this question, we consider the application of an audio cassette player. An audio tape is played in an audio
cassette player to produce an audio signal x that is bandlimited to frequencies @ in the range —4000x < @ < 4000z. In every
part of this question, the following comments apply: 1) you must show all steps in your solution; 2) your answer must be
fully justified (e.g., any identities, formulas, or theorems being used must be explicitly stated) and the logic leading to your
final answer must be clear; 3) zero marks will be given for a correct final answer that has a missing or incorrect justification.

(A) Determine the minimum rate at which x can be sampled such that x can be exactly reconstructed from its samples.
{1 mark]

(B) A mechanical engineering student, with too much spare time on their hands, modifies the audio cassette player so that it
plays a tape at a factor of 8 slower than the standard speed to produce the audio signal v(t) = x(t/8). Determine the minimum
rate at which v can be sampled such that v can be exactly reconstructed from its samples. [2 marks]

Question 2(b) Continued

(C) Not to be outdone by a mechanical engineering student, an electrical engineering student, with considerably more spare
time on their hands, builds an AM radio transmitter to broadcast the audio signal x to their classmates. The output y of the AM
transmitter is given by y(t) = x(t)cos(8000xf). Determine the minimum rate at which y can be sampled such that y can be
exactly reconstructed from its samples. [3 marks]

Question 3. A LTI system with the input x and output y has the frequency response H (@) = 3632021: Find the differential

equation that characterizes this system. You may use J to denote the derivative operator in your answer. [5 marks]
